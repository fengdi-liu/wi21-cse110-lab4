1. Before the function call, nothing will happen for line 11, since there is nothing to pass in. But after the function call, the line 11 will print out: 3, since the code is displying the i, which is the total number of prices.

2. Before the function call, nothing will happen for line 12, since there is nothing to pass in. But after the function call, the line 12 will print out: 150, since the code is displying the last price's discounted price, which is 300 * 0.5 = 150.

3. Before the function call, nothing will happen for line 13, since there is nothing to pass in. But after the function call, the line 13 will print out: 150, since the code is displying the last price's final price, which is  300 * 0.5 = 150.

4. The function will return:[ 50, 100, 150 ], since the function call will return the discounted, which is final price. And there are three prices passed in, each price times 0.5 will be their final price.

5. Before the function call, nothing will happen for line 11, since there is nothing to pass in. But after the function call, the line 11 will print out: 3, since the code is displying the i, which is the total number of prices.

6. Before the function call, nothing will happen for line 12, since there is nothing to pass in. But after the function call, error showed  "ReferenceError: discountedPrice is not defined". The variable discounted and finalPrice are defined as let, which is fine. But the "discountedPrice" is defined as let type in side a for loop, and for the let behave, it is not allowed to use inside the loop.  

7. Before the function call, nothing will happen for line 13, since there is nothing to pass in. But after the function call,error showed  "ReferenceError: discountedPrice is not defined". The variable discounted and finalPrice are defined as let, which is fine. But the "discountedPrice" is defined as let type in side a for loop, and for the let behave, it is not allowed to use inside the loop. And "finalPrice" is related to "discountedPrice", so error will keep to here.

6. Before the function call, nothing will happen for line 12, since there is nothing to pass in. But after the function call, error showed  "ReferenceError: discountedPrice is not defined". Since the "discountedPrice" is defined as const in side a for loop, and for the const behave, it is not allowed to use inside the loop.
