#### Part3 Solution ####
- The bug was caused by the variable type. The nums1 and num2 are string, and if you add two strings together, which will connect two strings together and return a string.
- I use type convert. parseInt(), to convert num1 and num2 into integer, and when 2 integers add up, will return a correct answer.
