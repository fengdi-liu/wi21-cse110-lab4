###### Dear instructor:  ######

I have my first version of part2.drawio.png before the lab due date. 

But after that I realize I might have a little mistake there, so  I fixed it, and create a new Part2.drawio.png (the P is upper case) there. 

Pease check the edited version: start with uppercase P. 

Sorry for the inconvience, and Thank you!
